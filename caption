🚀 New Project Spotlight: Sales Prediction with Machine Learning! 📊
Excited to share my latest project, where I developed a Sales Prediction Model to forecast sales based on advertising expenditures. This project is crucial for businesses to optimize their marketing strategies and maximize revenue! 💡
🔍 Project Highlights:
1️⃣ Data Exploration & Insights
Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the relationship between advertising budgets and sales.
Used pair plots, correlation heatmaps, and descriptive statistics to identify key trends and patterns.
2️⃣ Data Preprocessing
Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and scaling features for better model performance.
Ensured data consistency and readiness for training.
3️⃣ Model Development & Training
Implemented a Linear Regression model to predict sales based on advertising expenditure.
Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets for evaluation.
4️⃣ Performance Evaluation
Achieved high accuracy, measured using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), RMSE, and R² Score.
Visualized the actual vs. predicted sales to assess model performance.
5️⃣ New Sales Predictions
Used the trained model to forecast sales for new advertising budgets, providing valuable insights for business decision-making.
💡 Key Takeaways:
✅ Strengthened my understanding of predictive modeling and the full ML workflow from EDA to model evaluation.
✅ Gained hands-on experience with Linear Regression, data preprocessing, and visualization techniques.
✅ Learned the importance of feature scaling, correlation analysis, and model validation in sales forecasting.
